dApp Pi Network 

A decentralized app to bring a unique utility to 
The masses! Combined delivery, curbside pickup and 
Real/physical grocery shopping experience in a 
Single trip stopping to physically shop at only
One store for food/groceries.

The software does all the magic on the backend 
Organizing, price checking, list making (game...), 
recepie linking.


PiNg's business model revolves around:
 "Getting the best prices and deals available
 while making the shopping experience easier,
 more efficient, less cumbersome and entertaining."

Combining the organization of curbside pickup, 
doorstep delivery and real physical shops is a
feature consumers haven't coupon clipped into
The mainstream yet.
